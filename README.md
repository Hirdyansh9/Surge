# SURGE- Surgical Utility for Reinforcement-based Guidance and Evaluation 

SURGE is an AR/VR-based surgical training system that integrates:
  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for organ recognition and sub-part segmentation
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) to provide real-time corrective haptic feedback
  Immersive 3D Visualization through an AR/VR environment
  Haptic Devices to replicate tactile sensations

SURGE aims to enhance surgical skill acquisition by offering repeatable, cost-effective simulations that reduce reliance on cadaver-based training. This system will be used by medical trainees, surgical residents, and potentially expert surgeons who want to rehearse or refine techniques.
